# ​​FusNeoPred​​  
## Introduction
Fusion-derived neoantigens represent superior therapeutic targets for precision immunotherapy due to their high immunogenicity and clonality; however, their accurate identification is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and the gap between in silico predictions and biological reality. Here, we present FusNeoPred, a weakly supervised learning framework that innovatively integrates Nanopore long-read sequencing with digital twins. By superimposing precise transcriptomic structures onto the operational digital twinning, our approach moves beyond static prediction. The framework employs a multi-module scoring system, featuring a customized Sigmoid transformation for MHC binding metrics to better evaluate physiological immunogenicity. A defining innovation of our study is the closed-loop model calibration strategy utilizing real experimental data. We established a feedback mechanism where the computational model is rigorously fine-tuned using ground-truth results derived from peptide synthesis and IFN-γ ELISpot assays in humanized mice. This iterative assimilation of wet-lab data continuously corrects the virtual parameters to align with biological complexity. In summary, the FusNeoPred framework constructed in this study effectively identifies high-confidence fusion neoantigens, offering a scalable and biologically calibrated solution for the development of next-generation cancer vaccines.
